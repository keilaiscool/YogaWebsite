        <h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
        <p>The most popular style of yoga in the West is “Hatha Yoga”, which uses postures, 
            breathing and meditation techniques to create balance and harmony in your life.  
            The postures are designed to tone, strengthen and align the body and although 
            they are consistent in each style, the approach to each posture can vary.  
            The breath is directly tied to the energy in the body and acts as the bridge 
            between the mind, body and spirit.  Finally, meditation employs techniques to 
            work towards clarity and stillness of mind. Together these three aspects of Hatha 
            yoga help us practice being more alive and present to our experiences.

    <h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
       <p>The word “Vinyasa” translates to mean, “place in a special way” and can also be called 
        “flow yoga” or “vinyasa flow”.  This type of yoga is when movement and breath are linked 
        together in a rhythmic, continuous flow.  It was adapted from Ashtanga yoga in the 1980s 
        and is considered an athletic style of yoga. That, however, does not mean it is only for 
        advanced practitioners.  If a beginner is looking for a challenge, Vinyasa would be the 
        perfect place to start.  The flow is very meditative and even though you are moving, 
        usually one breath per movement, the mind and nervous system become calm. If you like to 
        move, this style is for you.</p>

    <h2>Restorative Yoga</h2>
        <p>Restorative yoga postures are held for long periods of time (sometimes five or more 
            minutes).  However, the goal of restorative yoga is to completely relax.  Props are 
            used to fully support and ground your body in order to enhance the parasympathetic 
            nervous system and completely de-stress.  It’s a great way to rest, both physically 
            and mentally.  It can also be used to help ease physical pain.  This type of yoga is 
            more about “being” rather than “doing.”</p>
